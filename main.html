                A chessboard consists of <i>64 squares</i> which can be split into 32 dark and 32 light squares. Both
                players have the same amount of <i>pieces</i> on the board which is <i>16</i> for each player. One
                player
                has the
                white pieces, the other the black pieces and the board looks like this:

                One important thing to mention is that when you place the board in front of you the square in the
                bottom-left corner must be a dark square. On the picture we have above our chessboard has numbers and
                letters on its edge. These numbers and letters split our chessboard into squares which makes us easier
                to
                identify them. It also helps to set up our board since if you are playing as white then the square in
                the
                bottom-left corner should be the A1 square otherwise (if you are playing as black) H8.

                    Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement.
                <ul>
                    <li> The <b>king</b> can move into any directions
                        (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) but exactly one square at a time. There is a special
                        move with the king called <a href="#castling">castling</a>, which is allowed once per game.</li>
                    <li>The <b>rook</b> can move any vacant squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                    <li>The <b>bishop</b> can move any number of vacant squares diagonally.</li>
                    <li>The <b>queen</b> can move any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or
                        diagonally.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <b>knight</b> can move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two
                        squares
                        horizontally
                        and one square vertically (forming a shape of an "L").</li>
                    <li><b>Pawns</b> have the most complex rulse of movement:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not
                            yet
                            moved,
                            a
                            pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both
                            squares
                            are
                            vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
                        </li>
                        <li>A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front
                            of
                            the
                            pawn. The pawn is involved in two special moves called <i>en passant</i> and
                            <i>promotion</i>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                A piece is captured when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is
                permanently removed from the game. The player controlling the white pieces called <b>"White"</b> the
                other called <b>"Black"</b>. White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required;
                it is not legal to skip a move. Them game continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a
                draw
                is declared. Checkmate is when a king is in check (attacked by an enemy piece) and it can't move from
                the square without still being in check. Either player may resign at any time and their opponent wins
                the game. Players typically resign when they believe they are very likely to lose the game. A draw
                occures when a king is on a square that is not attacked by any enemy piece and has no legal moves(king
                can't move to a square that is attacked) or there are no pieces on the board that can deliver checkmate
                (insufficient material).
