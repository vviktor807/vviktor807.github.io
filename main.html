                A chessboard consists of <b>64 squares</b> which can be split into 32 dark and 32 light squares. Both
                players have the same amount of <b>pieces</b> on the board which is <b>16</b> for each player. The rows
                called <b>ranks</b> and the columns called <b>files</b>. One
                player
                has the
                white pieces, the other the black pieces and the board looks like this:
            </p>

            <p>
                One important thing to mention is that when you place the board in front of you the square in the
                bottom-left corner must be a dark square. On the picture we have above our chessboard has numbers and
                letters on its edge. These numbers and letters split our chessboard into squares which makes us easier
                to
                identify them. It also helps to set up our board since if you are playing as white then the square in
                the
                bottom-left corner should be the A1 square otherwise (if you are playing as black) H8.

                        Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement.
                    <ul>
                        <li> The <b>king</b> can move into any directions
                            (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) but exactly one square at a time. There is a
                            special
                            move with the king called <a href="#castling">castling</a>, which is allowed once per game.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <b>rook</b> can move any vacant squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                        <li>The <b>bishop</b> can move any number of vacant squares diagonally.</li>
                        <li>The <b>queen</b> can move any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or
                            diagonally.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <b>knight</b> can move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two
                            squares
                            horizontally
                            and one square vertically (forming a shape of an "L").</li>
                        <li><b>Pawns</b> have the most complex rulse of movement:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not
                                yet
                                moved,
                                a
                                pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both
                                squares
                                are
                                vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
                            </li>
                            <li>A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front
                                of
                                the
                                pawn. The pawn is involved in two special moves called <a href="#en passant">en
                                    passant</a>
                                and
                                <a href="#promotion">promotion</a>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    A piece is captured when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is
                    permanently removed from the game. The player controlling the white pieces called <b>"White"</b> the
                    other called <b>"Black"</b>. White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is
                    required;
                    it is not legal to skip a move. The game continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or
                    a
                    draw
                    is declared. <b>Checkmate</b> is when a king is in check (attacked by an enemy piece) and it can't
                    move
                    from
                    the square without still being in check. A player can react to the check by moving the king,
                    capturing
                    the attacking piece or blocking it by moving a piece between the king and the attacking piece(except
                    against a knight since knights cannot be blocked). Either player may <b>resign</b> at any time and
                    their
                    opponent wins
                    the game. Players typically resign when they believe they are very likely to lose the game. A
                    <b>draw</b>
                    occures when a king is on a square that is not attacked by any enemy piece and has no legal
                    moves(king
                    can't move to a square that is attacked) or there are no pieces on the board that can deliver
                    checkmate
                    (insufficient material).
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="castling">Castling</h4>
                    <p>Castling is when you move the king 2 squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other
                        side
                        of the king, adjecent to it. Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are no pieces between the king and the rook.</li>
                        <li>The king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through any square that is under attack
                            by an
                            enemy piece, or move to a square that would result in check.</li>
                        <li>Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="en passant">En passant</h4>
                    <p>
                        When a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to the
                        opponent's pawn, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, as if it had moved only one
                        square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the
                        first pawn's advance.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="promotion">Promotion</h4>
                    <p>
                        If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a
                        queen,
                        rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually
                        chosen).
                        The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for
                        a
                        player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns
                        are
                        promoted.
