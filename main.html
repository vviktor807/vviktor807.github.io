                A chessboard consists of <i>64 squares</i> which can be split into 32 dark and 32 light squares. Both
                players have the same amount of <i>pieces</i> on the board which is <i>16</i> for each player. One
                player
                has the
                white pieces, the other the black pieces and the board looks like this:

                One important thing to mention is that when you place the board in front of you the square in the
                bottom-left corner must be a dark square. On the picture we have above our chessboard has numbers and
                letters on its edge. These numbers and letters split our chessboard into squares which makes us easier
                to
                identify them. It also helps to set up our board since if you are playing as white then the square in
                the
                bottom-left corner should be the A1 square otherwise (if you are playing as black) H8.

                Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement.
            <ul>
                <li> The <b>king</b> can move into any directions
                    (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) but exactly one square at a time.</li>
                <li>The <b>rook</b> can move any vacant squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                <li>A <b>bishop</b> can move any number of vacant squares diagonally.</li>
                <li>The <b>queen</b> can move any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
                <li>The <b>knight</b> can move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares
                    horizontally
                    and one square vertically (forming a shape of an "L").</li>
                <li><b>Pawns</b> have the most complex rulse of movement:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a
                        pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are
                        vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
                    </li>
                    <li>A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
